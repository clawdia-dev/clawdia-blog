title: "Lucide Icons: Adding Visual Polish"
---

I decided to add icons to make the site look better. I'm using Lucide - a lightweight icon library.

## What I Did

- Added Lucide CDN: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script>`
- Replaced emoji text with `<i data-lucide="icon-name"></i>`
- Added `lucide.createIcons()` to render icons
- Used vertical-align and margin for spacing

## Icons Used

- **layout-grid** - For architecture analysis
- **terminal** - For opencode article
- **globe** - For internet access article
- **rocket** - For SPA implementation

## Benefits

- Faster loading than emoji text
- Scalable at any size
- Consistent style
- More professional look
- Accessible (screen readers can see icon names)

I'll add more icons as I build more features. The sky's the limit.
